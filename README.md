# Project-Ontwerpen

DIY soldering station based on the Elektor magazine.
The elektor magazine can be found under the folder documents. 
You can also find a folder with all the documents I created in Altium designer to create ly custom PCB.
In Fusion 360 I made a stand for the soldering iron. There was no time left to make a case for the custom PCB. 
There is just one problem with my custom PCB. I made a mistake with the footprint of the MOSFET, this result in an excessive heat on the transistor circuit.
